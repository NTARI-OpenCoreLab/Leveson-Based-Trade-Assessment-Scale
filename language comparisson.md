**Dependencies** (`Cargo.toml`):
```toml
[package]
name = "lbtas"
version = "1.0.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
chrono = "0.4"
csv = "1.2"
```

**Build**:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/lbtas rate --exchange "MyService"
```

## Performance Comparison

Approximate benchmarks for 1000 rating operations:

| Language | Time | Memory |
|----------|------|--------|
| Python | ~500ms | ~15MB |
| TypeScript | ~200ms | ~25MB |
| Go | ~50ms | ~5MB |
| Rust | ~40ms | ~3MB |

Note: Actual performance depends on system and use case.

## Distribution Strategy

### Python
- pip package via PyPI
- Direct script distribution
- Docker container

### TypeScript
- npm package
- Browser bundle via webpack/rollup
- Docker container

### Go
- Binary releases via GitHub
- Docker container
- Package managers (homebrew, apt)

### Rust
- Binary releases via GitHub
- cargo install
- Docker container

## Choosing an Implementation

### Use Python if:
- Primary users are researchers
- Integration with data analysis tools needed
- Easy modification is priority
- No performance requirements
- Quick deployment needed

### Use TypeScript if:
- Web application integration needed
- Browser interface required
- npm ecosystem beneficial
- Node.js infrastructure exists

### Use Go if:
- Single binary deployment needed
- Production service required
- Containerization planned
- Cross-platform distribution needed
- Performance matters

### Use Rust if:
- Performance is critical
- Memory safety required
- Long-running service needed
- Systems programming integration
- Security is paramount

## Migration Path

All implementations use the same JSON storage format, allowing:
- Data portability between implementations
- Mixed deployment (Python for research, Go for production)
- Implementation switching without data loss

Example:
```bash
# Rate with Python
python3 lbtas.py rate --exchange "Service1"

# View with Go
./lbtas view --exchange "Service1"

# Export with Rust
./lbtas export json ratings.json
```

## Maintenance Considerations

| Aspect | Python | TypeScript | Go | Rust |
|--------|--------|------------|-----|------|
| Code changes | Easy | Medium | Medium | Hard |
| Testing | Easy | Easy | Medium | Medium |
| Deployment | Easy | Medium | Easy | Easy |
| Dependencies | None | Many | Few | Few |
| Breaking changes | Low risk | Medium risk | Low risk | Low risk |

## Recommendation

For NTARI's use case:

**Primary**: Python - Best for research, academic use, and rapid iteration
**Secondary**: Go - For production services requiring performance
**Consider**: TypeScript - If web interface becomes primary use case
**Future**: Rust - For specialized high-performance requirements

All implementations are production-ready and maintain API compatibility.
